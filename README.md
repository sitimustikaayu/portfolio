## Summary Insight

### Convince the museum board 
The Firehouse Museum claims they ran an event in 2014 that brought an incredible number of visitors, and that they should get extra budget to run a similar event again.  The other museums think these types of events aren't that important, and budgets should be split purely based on recent visitors on an average day.

### Assess seasonality
When meeting with the employees at Avila Adobe, one major pain point is that the number of museum visitors varies greatly with the seasons, with low seasons (when the employees are perfectly staffed and happy) and also high seasons (when the employees are understaffed and stressed). You realize that if you can predict these high and low seasons, you can plan ahead to hire some additional seasonal employees to help out with the extra work.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Show the museum board how the event compared to regular traffic at each museum and the number of visitors to each museum evolved over time.
- The line chart generally dips to relatively low values around the early part of each year (in December and January), and reaches its highest values in the middle of the year (especially around May and June). Thus, Avila Adobe usually gets more visitors in March-August (or the spring and summer months). With this in mind, Avila Adobe could definitely benefit from hiring more seasonal employees to help with the extra work in March-August (the spring and summer)
