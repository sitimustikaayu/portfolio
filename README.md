## Summary Insight

### Convince the museum board 
The Firehouse Museum claims they ran an event in 2014 that brought an incredible number of visitors, and that they should get extra budget to run a similar event again.  The other museums think these types of events aren't that important, and budgets should be split purely based on recent visitors on an average day.
Key Observations:
- Avila Adobe consistently had the highest number of visitors compared to the other museums, with noticeable fluctuations but generally ranging between 15,000 to over 40,000 visitors per month.
- Firehouse Museum shows a significant spike in late 2014, reaching over 60,000 visitors in a single month — much higher than any other data point. After that, its visitor numbers dropped and remained relatively stable at a much lower level.
- Chinese American Museum had the lowest visitor numbers, mostly staying below 5,000 visitors per month, showing relatively stable but low traffic.
- America Tropical Interpretive Center had moderate and fairly consistent visitor numbers, mostly between 4,000 to 12,000 visitors per month, with some small fluctuations over time.

### Assess seasonality
When meeting with the employees at Avila Adobe, one major pain point is that the number of museum visitors varies greatly with the seasons, with low seasons (when the employees are perfectly staffed and happy) and also high seasons (when the employees are understaffed and stressed). You realize that if you can predict these high and low seasons, you can plan ahead to hire some additional seasonal employees to help out with the extra work.
Key Observations:
- 2014 to mid-2015: Visitor numbers fluctuated significantly, often ranging between 20,000 to over 35,000, with several sharp peaks. The highest point occurred around mid-2015, reaching over 40,000 visitors in a single month.
- 2016 to 2017: Visitor counts began to stabilize, showing a more regular up-and-down pattern but with a slight downward trend overall. Monthly visitors mostly stayed between 15,000 to 30,000.
- 2018: A noticeable decline is observed. Visitor numbers consistently dropped to below 25,000, reaching some of the lowest points in the entire period by the end of 2018.

## Recommendations & Next Steps  
- Avila Adobe was the most popular site during this time period, while the Chinese American Museum attracted the fewest visitors. The spike in the Firehouse Museum data could indicate a special event or data anomaly in late 2014.
- Avila Adobe usually gets more visitors in March-August (or the spring and summer months). With this in mind, Avila Adobe could definitely benefit from hiring more seasonal employees to help with the extra work in March-August (the spring and summer)
- The Avila Adobe museum experienced strong visitor interest in the early years (2014–2015), but over time, attendance gradually declined. This may suggest changing public interest, reduced promotions, seasonal factors, or external influences affecting tourism. The trend highlights the importance of engagement strategies to maintain or grow museum attendance.
